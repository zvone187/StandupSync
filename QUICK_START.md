# StandupSync - Quick Start Guide

## 🎉 All Issues Fixed!

Your StandupSync application is now fully functional and ready to use.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Standup Creation
- **Before:** Standups could be created for past dates and appeared under wrong days
- **After:** Can only create standups for TODAY in the CURRENT week
- **Test it:** Try creating a standup now!

### 2. Standup Editing
- **Before:** Edit button might not show even for today's standups
- **After:** Edit button reliably appears for standups created today
- **Test it:** Create a standup and click "Edit"

### 3. Email Invitations
- **Status:** Already working! ✅
- **Check:** Backend logs show emails are being sent successfully
- **Note:** Check your spam folder if you don't see the invitation email

### 4. Slack Notifications
- **Status:** Code ready, needs your configuration ⏳
- **Action:** Follow `SLACK_SETUP_GUIDE.md` (takes 10-15 minutes)
- **Optional:** Set up now or later - app works without it

## 📋 Optional: Set Up Slack (15 Minutes)

If you want automatic Slack notifications when standups are created:

**Follow this guide:** `SLACK_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

**Quick summary:**
1. Create Slack app at https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Add bot permissions: `chat:write`, `chat:write.public`, `commands`, `channels:read`
3. Install to workspace and copy bot token (starts with `xoxb-`)
4. Get your channel ID
5. Configure in database:
```javascript
mongosh
use standupsynclite
db.teamsettings.updateOne(
  { teamId: "68f800fa7b61d6fe0d9eda77" },
  {
    $set: {
      slackAccessToken: "xoxb-your-token-here",
      slackChannelId: "C01234ABCDE"
    }
  },
  { upsert: true }
)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the Create button"

**Possible reasons:**
- You already created a standup for today ✅
- You're viewing a past week (navigate to current week) ✅
- You're viewing someone else's tab (switch to "You") ✅

### "I don't see the Edit button"

**Possible reasons:**
- Standup is from a past day (can only edit today's standups) ✅
- You're viewing someone else's standup (can only edit your own) ✅

### "Email invitation not received"

**Check:**
- Spam/junk folder 📧
- Correct email address 📧
- Backend logs show "✅ Invitation email sent successfully" ✅

**Whitelist:** noreply@standupsynclite.com

### "Slack notifications not working"

**Reason:** Slack is not configured yet

**Solution:** Follow `SLACK_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

**Quick check:**
```bash
# Check if Slack is configured
mongosh
use standupsynclite
db.teamsettings.findOne({ teamId: "68f800fa7b61d6fe0d9eda77" })

# Should show slackAccessToken and slackChannelId
```
